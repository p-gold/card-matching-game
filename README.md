## Instructions
The game is a card matching game otherwise called a memory game, to play it, the player (user) should aim at finding cards that matches each other by clicking on the cards to open them. If the user clicks a card the first card clicked on waits for the second card to be clicked open, and if they contain the same image, the two cards will stay open, otherwise they will close back automatically.

 Immediately the user clicks the game, the timer starts counting till the game ends. Then the stars decreases after 4 clicks (opening two cards makes one click here). Then the moves counter start counting the number of two cards opened. 

This process continues until the player has successfully matched the cards. After that, a congratulatory modal which contains a summary of time elapsed, Number of moves made and how many stars left will pop out to congratulate the player. Now the player can click on the close button at the top right hand of the modal to close it or click on the button with label 'Repo' to view the game github repository or Replay to play again. 


## Running
To run the project, Just click on the project link and the browser will load it, Since its an online game, right there in the browser, you can start playing it.
    **Running it locally**
   However, you can run it locally by following the below instructions below

## Implementation
As the developer, i was responsible for the approach i took to arrive to the working game from layout to the javaScript codes, In the layout part, i used the css modern layout (Grid and Flexbox),  while in the javaScript i used the modern javaScript approach (ES6) and Functional programming paradigms.

## Responsiveness
This was the part that drived me nuts during the project as i was trying to avoid the use of any framework. 
As front-end developers, we strive hard to make sure that our projects fits well in different screen sizes and i am  happy that i was able to achieve that at the end of the project without the use of any framework.
This avoidance of any framework helped me to understand how things works under the hood of screen sizes and responsiveness as a whole.

## Dependencies
This game depends on font-awesome for a minor part of its functionality like the reset button, and google fonts for its fonts. apart from that, every other thing is manually done.

## Experience
During the course of developing this game, i gained a lot of experience from DOM manipulation to basic algorithm and adding classes. 
The game made me do  more research on some of the algorithm i ve been neglecting since.

## Appreciation
My special thanks goes to  the chingu community for giving me the opportunity to challenge myself with this project, actually  i learnt a lot in the process of developing this game.
